### What I learned

I picked up Svelte over the weekend and this is the first project after the official tutorial I worked on to utilize my knowledge. While I was utilizing only the basic concepts it helped me better understand how to structure data and send information between different componenet. By no means this is the best approach to solving the issue described in the challenge as it's definitely over-engineered but having design requirements upfront helped me focus on the FED implementation.
